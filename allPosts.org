#+HUGO_BASE_DIR: ./
#+TITLE: Ian Hocking

* Setup

We'll go with ox-hugo and use the instructions suggested by this kind individual: [[http://petercheng.net/posts/website-v2-setup/][Publishing a Website from Emacs and Hugo · Peter Cheng]]

I've created a new directory for my files here [[file+emacs:~/Dropbox/org/blog/programmer]]

~Hugo~ is installed.

Package ~ox-hugo~ is installed.

I like the look of the ~hugo-coder~ theme, and I've added it to ~themes~. The
full set of parameters (for ~config.toml~) are in [[https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/wiki/Configurations#complete-example][Configurations · luizdepra/hugo-coder Wiki · GitHub]].

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd ~/Dropbox/org/blog
hugo new site programmer
cd programmer && git clone https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder.git themes/hugo-coder
#+END_SRC

Let's look at the .toml file, which contains important settings.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output
cat ~/Dropbox/org/blog/programmer/config.toml
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
baseURL = "http://example.org/"
languageCode = "en-gb"
title = "Ian Hocking"

theme = "programmer"

[params]
    author = "Ian Hocking"
    authorimage = "http://ianhocking.com/wordpress/wp-content/IMG_8348-682x1024.jpg"
    description = "Chips with Everything"
    highlightjs = true
    highlightjsstyle = "zenburn"
    highlightjslanguages = ["lisp"]
[params.social]
    github = "OolonColoophid"
    linkedin = "ianhocking"

[[menu.main]]
    name = "Posts"
    weight = 100
    identifier = "posts"
    url = "/posts/"
[[menu.main]]
    name = "About"
    identifier = "about"
    weight = 200
    url = "/about/"
#+end_example

The site should export automatically on save, thanks to the file
~.dir-locals.el~, which sets ~org-hugo-auto-export-mode~.

When updating, we can have the Hugo server take us directly to the page that has
changed like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
#+END_SRC

** Permanently Set File-Local Variables in Doom Emacs :emacs:doom:elisp:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: local_variables_doom
:EXPORT_DATE: 2019-09-09
:END:

From time to time, it's useful to set local variables within an ~org~
file. For instance, I have a file whose subsections I'd like to
encrypt. This being the case, I need to turn off autosave (since this could save
plain text). To do this for the buffer, I add this to the top:

#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle no
# -*- buffer-auto-save-file-name: nil; -*-
#+END_SRC

Emacs is understandably wary of running elisp simply because it exists in the
file, however. Upon opening this buffer, it warns:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The local variables list in [filename] contains variables that are
risky
#+END_QUOTE

This is followed by a question about allowing them on this occasion only.
Globally, the level of wariness is controlled by the variable
~enable-local-variables~, whose explanation is given here: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/File-Local-Variables.html#File-Local-Variables][File Local
Variables - GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual]].

I would, however, like to avoid setting this globally. I'd prefer that Emacs
adds safe
variables to a whitelist. I'd consider turning off autosave to be reasonably
safe, so the first thing I tried was adding it to the whitelist. The safe variable is called
~safe-local-variable-values~ and is defined in the Emacs installation itself (i.e.
in ~/usr/local~, where my Emacs installation lives).

Because I use [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]], I put the following into my ~./config/Doom/config.el~ (which is actually tangled
from my ~config.org~):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'safe-local-variable-values '("buffer-auto-save-filename" . "nil") t)
#+END_SRC

But this didn't work. At first, I thought that perhaps the above elisp is running too
early, as the list when I inspected it after opening Emacs showed only the
original values (referring to variables relevant to other files). How late, I
wondered, could I make this code run? After the ~org~ module is loaded?[fn:org]

[fn:org] The ~after! org~ is a Doom wrapper function that ensures the elisp
codes that follows is evaluated after a given module is loaded.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! org
  (add-to-list 'safe-local-variable-values '("buffer-auto-save-filename" . "nil") t)
  )
#+END_SRC

Still no luck.

It turns out that ~safe-local-variables~ was being set in
~/.config/Doom/init.el~--this should have been before my ~config.el~, and yet my
~config.el~ code was not modifying the variable.

Fine, I thought--I'll carefully edit the part of the ~init.el~ setting
~safe-local-variables~. But I still saw the same behaviour in my target file: I
was being asked, temporarily, if I wanted to permit the variable
~buffer-auto-save-file-name~ to be set. Why wouldn't my method work? I wasn't
sure. But since Doom had set the variables successfully before from other ~org~
files previousl, writing them to ~safe-local-variables~ in its own ~init.el~, I
had a look at how those files set variables and I saw that it was done in a
slightly different manner:

: * Local variables :noexport:
: # local variables:
: # +org-export-directory: "projects/"
: # end:

I tried this with my problematic file. First schoolboy error: I didn't place
it at the end of the file. This fixed, I tried again. But Emacs persisted in
prompting me to only allow setting ~buffer-auto-save-filename~ temporarily. Why not permanently?

I went back and looked again at the elisp in my ~/.config/Doom/init.el~ and
realised that I had put ~NIL~ in quotes. Second schoolboy error. Of course, it
shouldn't have quotes---it needs to be plain old ~NIL~. The correct code in the
~.init~ is thus:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.

** TODO Blogging with Emacs, Hugo and Org Mode                       :setup:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: settingUpBlog
:EXPORT_DATE: 2019-09-01
:END:

This blog is brand--not to say spanking--new. For a while, this summer, I was in
the process of transitioning out of my current role (a story another time), I
was thinking about updating my web presence. Not that I don't have one. I've
been on the [[https://twitter.com/ian_hocking?lang=en-gb][the Twitter]] and Facebook for a long old time, and my blog dates back
to [[http://ianhocking.com/2003/02/heres-email-from-my-dad-that-i-just.html][2003]]. But my online identity focused mainly my fiction writing. I want to change its
focus to coding, which, I hope, is the direction in which I'm now
heading.

Like James May in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77BG4qkviWc][the Reassembler]], I want to slowly take this blog apart and put
it back together again.

My first tool is [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]][fn:emacs], free software dating from the 1970s. I came to
Emacs from [[https://www.vim.org][Vim]]. I've written elsewhere about my preference for text-based (i.e.
non-GUI) tools, and I have an idea for a post to this blog where I talk about my
current Emacs setup.

Next is a static website generation framework called [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]]. A key aim of the Hugo
project is that sites are pre-compiled. The server need only offer HTML, and
very little in-the-moment calculation happens on the server or the browser. This
means small, fast websites. Hugo has an active theming community, too. It never
ceases to amaze me that folks around the world are willing to offer their time
to such projects--not just the themes, of course, but the Hugo project itself.

Last, I'll be leaning heavily on [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]], a part of Emacs that started as a
fancy outlining framework but became a wonderful system for storing, organising
and exporting information. Contributors have created adjuncts to org-mode, and
one such is ox-hugo[fn:oxhugo]

*** Org Mode Blogging Solutions







[fn:emacs] GNU Emacs 26.2, running on macOS 10.14.6.


[fn:oxhugo] I believe the ~ox~ part stands for org export.


*** Emacs

- Auto export

*** Org Mode

- Literate coding

*** Static Speed

*** Installation


*** My Old Blog

** Using Git Hooks to Automate Blog Publishing                         :git:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: gitHooks
:EXPORT_DATE: 2019-09-10
:END:
*** Background
This blog is produced from a plaintext [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] file
that is passed to an ~org~ module called
[[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]]. Essentially, ~ox-hugo~ looks at the
~org~ file and produces
[[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown]] files, which are then
processed by a static website generation framework called
[[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/][Hugo]]. It goes without saying that these
are all fantastic, free tools.

*** My Prior Workflow

Originally, when ready to publish the blog, I would save the ~org~ file[fn:write]--this would trigger
an export process[fn:ox-auto] that produced the Markdown files. This would result in a
Hugo-friendly set of files that Hugo could then chew through to produce a
complete static website. I put together this workflow based largely on this
great post from Peter Cheng,
[[http://petercheng.net/posts/website-v2-setup/][Publishing a Website from Emacs
and Hugo]].

The Bash script to render and upload the site looks like this:

#+NAME: deploy.sh
#+CAPTION: Contents of the file ~deploy.sh~
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Sync /public (containing finalised HTML and resources)
# to webserver (e.g. ianhocking.com)

# e - exit if command exits with error
# u - treat unset variables as an error
set -eu

username="username"
server="servername"

blogDir="/Users/ianuser/Dropbox/org/blog/programmer"

# Remove previous build of site
rm -r "$blogDir/public" || echo "No /public directory in blog directory $blogDir to delete"

# Build
cd $blogDir && hugo || echo "Cannot cd to blog directory $blogDir"

# Upload
rsync -r --verbose --compress --human-readable --progress --recursive public/. $username@$server:public_html/blog/
#+END_SRC


*** Why Change?

Until yesterday, the [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]][fn:git] repository containing
the source of my site was private, but I decided that I wanted to put into the
~ox-hugo~ [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/examples/][showcase]], so now it's
available on Github [[https://github.com/OolonColoophid/blog][here]].

*** Git Hooks

Git allows ~hooks~, which are simply scripts run by Git[fn:gitH]. You can find a
fuller explanation of them in various places.
[[https://hackernoon.com/automate-your-workflow-with-git-hooks-fef5d9b2a58c][Automate
Your Workflow with Git Hooks]] is a good one.

Essentially, with the directory holding your tracked files, you'll see
~.git/hooks~. Inside that, there are the hooks themselves.

Let's take a look at them.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports output :results output
ls -g ~/Dropbox/org/blog/programmer/.git/hooks
#+END_SRC

Gives us:

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
applypatch-msg.sample
commit-msg.sample
copy_of_post-update
fsmonitor-watchman.sample
post-commit
post-update
pre-applypatch.sample
pre-commit.sample
pre-push
pre-push.sample
pre-rebase.sample
pre-receive.sample
prepare-commit-msg.sample
resources
update.sample
#+end_example

Some of these hooks are designed to be run by Git on a server (i.e.
receiving updates) and others locally (i.e. when sending). The details of which
hook suits which end of the process are provided by [[https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks][Git - githooks Documentation]].

The two hooks I'm interested in are ~post-commit~ and ~pre-push~. In the
directory listing above, you can see that both of these have the suffix
~.sample~ removed; that means that Git will pay attention to them. Additionally,
to make sure that the hooks execute (which are simple Bash scripts after all), we need to
make sure that execution privileges have been assigned:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
chmod +x ls ~/Dropbox/org/blog/programmer/.git/hooks/post-commit
chmod +x ls ~/Dropbox/org/blog/programmer/.git/hooks/pre-push
#+END_SRC

*** My New Workflow

When I commit a change to the repository, I'd like ~git commit~ to run the hook
[[gitPost][post-commit]]. This hook will itself call ~git push~, which will notice the
[[gitPre][pre-push]] hook and then run [[deploy.sh][my deployment script]].

It's vitally important that the deployment script itself doesn't make changes to
the working tree, or we'll end up in a situation where Git branches diverge--a
difficult error to troubleshoot. For this reason, my ~.gitignore~ excludes:
~content/~, ~public~ and ~logs~.
~

#+NAME: gitPost
#+CAPTION: .git/hooks/post-commit
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh

{ echo '-- ' &&
	date &&
	echo 'Git hook .git/hooks/post-commit executed by git-commit' &&
	echo 'Hook will push master branch to remote origin' ; } >> /Users/ianuser/Dropbox/org/blog/programmer/logs/hooks.log

git push origin master

#+END_SRC

#+NAME: gitPre
#+CAPTION: .git/hooks/pre-push
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh

{ echo '-- ' &&
	date &&
	echo 'Git hook .git/hooks/pre-push executed by git-push' &&
	echo 'Hook will call deploy.sh' ; } >> /Users/ianuser/Dropbox/org/blog/programmer/logs/hooks.log

/Users/ianuser/Dropbox/org/blog/programmer/deploy.sh
#+END_SRC

Finally, I'm now able
to make a commit--this will get pushed to my [[https://github.com/OolonColoophid][Github repository]], the site built,
an the site uploaded to [[http://ianhocking.com][ianhocking.com]].
