Hi, I'm Ian.

I live in Canterbury with my wife and several gerbils.

Following a successful career in academic psychology researching psycholinguistics
and creativity[^fn:1], I'm now enjoying opportunities
and challenges in my first love, software development. I enrolled on the University
of Kent's [MSc in Computer Science](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/243/computer-science)[^fn:2] in September 2019 and graduated in
2021with distinction. I'm currently working as a software developer at [Literature and Latte](https://www.literatureandlatte.com).

Check out my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ygg3hlda4igj1y2/cv.pdf?dl=1)/[PhD](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pa7ymvusgifhvt2/Resources%20and%20Parsing%20thesis%20Hocking.pdf?dl=1).

Are you looking for my old blog This Writing Life? [It lives!](http://ianhocking.com/2012/06/19/%E2%98%85-the-cabinet-of-curiosities/) But is seldom updated.

Take care!
