Baker Street is a natural deduction tool for macOS written in Swift. It is open
source and you can [view the code on Github](https://github.com/OolonColoophid/bakerStreet).


## Manual {#manual}

[Download](https://ianhocking.com/manuals/BakerStreet%5Fv1.0%5Fmanual.pdf).


## Overview {#overview}

Available for macOS (10.12 -), Baker Street is a free-form tool that helps you produce natural deduction proofs in propositional logic. Use Baker Street to enter your proof, check for errors, clarify relationships between proof lines, preview, and export your proof in several formats.

Type your proof in a free-form manner. Baker Street provides automatic line numbering and feedback to help you see where you've gone wrong.

Baker Street is great for creating new proofs, inspecting sample proofs, and exporting them to a variety of formats, all within a native macOS experience.

Baker Street was developed by Ian Hocking under the supervision of Dr Olaf Chitil at the School of Computing, University of Kent, UK, as an MSc Computer Science summer project.
