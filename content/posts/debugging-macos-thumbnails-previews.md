# Debugging Thumbnails and Previews in macOS

If, like me, you're a macOS developer working with app extensions, particularly those that generate file thumbnails and previews, you might have found debugging these components to be challenging. This post walks through the process of attaching a debugger to thumbnail and preview extensions on macOS Sequoia (15.4.1). It contains pointers that I've picked up here and there.

## Understanding QuickLook and App Extensions

So macOS uses the QuickLook framework to generate thumbnails and previews for files in Finder. When you develop an app that handles custom file types, you can create two types of extensions:

1. **Thumbnail Extension**: Generates small previews of your files shown in Finder icons
2. **Preview Extension**: Provides the larger preview when users press the spacebar, look at an 'Info' view of file in Finder, and so on

These run as separate processes, outside your main application, making them difficult to debug through standard methods.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, check that you have:

- Xcode (latest version recommended)
- A macOS app with thumbnail and/or preview extensions
- Basic understanding of the extension lifecycle
- Possibly a system with System Integrity Protection (SIP) disabled for certain debugging scenarios
- A [weak lemon drink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4Cm0o_wxKs)

## Step-by-Step Debugging Process

### 1. Clean Your Environment

Ensure you're working with a clean environment:

- Remove any existing versions of your app from your Applications folder
- Consider clearing Xcode's Derived Data directory (though this may cause build failures requiring clean and rebuild)

### 2. Prepare Your Application

- Build and archive a properly signed version of your application
- Install it in your Applications folder (~Applications)

This ensures the system recognizes your extensions correctly.

### 3. Reset the QuickLook System

Open Terminal and run these commands using [qlmanage](https://ss64.com/mac/qlmanage.html):

```bash
qlmanage -r         # Force reload of Generators list
qlmanage -r cache   # Reset thumbnail disk cache
```

These commands refresh QuickLook's awareness of available extensions.

### 4. Trigger the Extensions

- Open your application from the Applications folder (this loads the app extensions)
- Open a new Finder window and search for files your extensions handle
- Your thumbnail extension should now be running

If extensions aren't running:
- Restart Finder (`killall Finder`)
- Restart the thumbnail agent (`killall com.apple.quicklook.ThumbnailsAgent`)
- Manually trigger QuickLook by selecting one of your files and pressing spacebar

### 5. Verify Extension Processes

To confirm the correct versions of your extensions are running:
- Open Activity Monitor
- Find your extension processes (mine usually have names like "YourApp Thumbnail" or "YourApp Preview")
- Check Info > Executable Path to ensure they're running from ~/Applications, not some copy that might be in Derived Data

### 6. Prepare for Debugging

In Xcode:
- Set at least one breakpoint in your thumbnail or preview extension code

This helps Xcode know to switch debugging sessions when the extension is hit.

### 7. Attach the Debugger

In Xcode:
1. Go to Debug > Attach to Process
2. Select your extension process (by PID or name)
3. Debug as "Me"
4. Use "Automatic" toolchain
5. Enable "Malloc Stack" logging for memory debugging

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If you see "Failed to create extensionProcess" errors in logs, try resetting QuickLook and restarting the ThumbnailsAgent
- Extensions must be properly code signed to work correctly in production
- The correct executables should be running from your Applications folder, not from Xcode's build directories
- If thumbnails still don't appear, check Console.app for any relevant error messages

## Advanced Techniques

For persistent issues:
- Use `log stream --predicate 'subsystem contains "quicklook"'` to monitor QuickLook-related log messages
- Check `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache` to see if your thumbnails are being cached
- Examine `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.QuickLookDaemon.plist` for QuickLook configuration issues

That's it for now. Mind how you go.
