      <description>I wrote the below in the late spring of 2021.
Small Packages My wife, Britta, went to bed a few minutes before me, calling down, &amp;lsquo;Good night!&amp;rsquo; as I was locking the front door. Just before I called back, I thought I heard a stranger say, &amp;lsquo;Good night.&amp;rsquo;
I called, &amp;lsquo;What did you say?&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;Nothing&amp;mdash;did you say something?&amp;rsquo;
Naturally, I went to bed thinking that there was a person in our house&amp;mdash;friendly enough, it seemed&amp;mdash;wishing us both a good night.</description>
