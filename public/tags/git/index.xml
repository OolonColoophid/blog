      <description>Background This blog is produced from a plaintext Org mode file that is passed to an org module called ox-hugo. Essentially, ox-hugo looks at the org file and produces Markdown, which is then processed by a static website generation framework called Hugo.
My Original Workflow When ready to publish, I would save the org file1&amp;ndash;this would trigger an export process that produced the Markdown files. This would result in a Hugo-friendly set of files that Hugo could then chew through to produce a complete static website.</description>
