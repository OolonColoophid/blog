      <title>Using Git Hooks to Automate Blog Publishing</title>

      <description>Background This blog is produced from a plaintext Org mode file that is passed to an org module called ox-hugo. Essentially, ox-hugo looks at the org file and produces Markdown files, which are then processed by a static website generation framework called Hugo. It goes without saying that these are all fantastic, free tools.
My Prior Workflow Originally, when ready to publish the blog, I would save the org file1&amp;ndash;this would trigger an export process2 that produced the Markdown files.</description>
