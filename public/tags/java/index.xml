      <description>One of the trickiest concepts of my MSc in Computer Science is recursion, which is defined as the act of &amp;lsquo;calling oneself&amp;rsquo;. In the context of computer functions, calling oneself is useful because it means doing whatever the function just did, but again, on something it has produced. Tricky to get your head around; even writing that last sentence was difficult!
As part of the learning process, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to clarify why I find recursion hard.</description>
